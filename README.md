# Rubik-s-Cube

Project Description:
This project is called the "Rubik's Cube Solver". It allows the user to input
a Rubik's Cube and if the cube is valid, the program will show a solution. The
user can also press a button to generate a random scrambled cube and the
program will show the solution to that cube.

Usage:
To run the Rubik's Cube Solver, open the cubeInput.py file and run it. This will
open up the GUI in a Tkinter window.

Shortcut Commands:
There is a scramble button that automatically produces a random, legal cube.
In the solver mode, there is a fast-forward button you can click on while
the cube is solving itself that will increase the speed from 1.5 seconds per
move to 0.1 seconds per move.
